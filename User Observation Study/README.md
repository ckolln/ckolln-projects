## User Observation Study

A User Observation study conducted as part of the CIS 443/543 User Interfaces curriculum. This was a final project for this class in which we were tasked to compare two different system in a thorough user observation study. After our reports were turned in we presented our studies to the class. Some of the systems chosen by other students included: comparing Apple Music and Spotify interfaces, Google Calendar and Apple Calendar, and two versions of World of Warcraft. I chose to compare two equipment logging systems: one currently in use at University of Oregon housing and one that I created to address what I felt during my employment there were glaring holes in the current system. 

I had a subject pool of 5 users, and I had them use both systems. My findings can be found in the report and presentation in this repository.
